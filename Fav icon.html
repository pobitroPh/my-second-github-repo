<p><b>Introduction:</b> The name of my country is <a href="https://www.bing.com/travel/place-information?q=Bangladesh&SID=c5fa012f-7347-0857-872b-2a5efc180846&form=DESTML&entrypoint=DESTML"><strong>Bangladesh</strong></a>, Its official (প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক) name is the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. In the past, it was a part of the Indian subcontinent (উপমহাদেশ) and then Pakistan. It became an independent country after a bloody (রক্তক্ষয়ী) war in <strong>1971.</strong></p>
<p><b>Land Area and Boundaries:</b> The total land area of Bangladesh is 57,320 square miles (148,460 square kilometers). It is bounded (আবদ্ধ) by the Indian states of West Bengal to the west and north, Assam to the north, Meghalaya to the north and northeast, and Tripura and Mizoram to the east, by Myanmar (Burma) to the southeast, and by the Bay of Bengal to the south.</p>
<p><b>Population:</b> The total population of the country is about 164.7 million. It is one of the most densely (ঘনভাবে) populated country in the world. 2,400- 2,700 people live per square mile. The density (ঘনত্ব) of the population is highest in Dhaka. About 4,500 people live per square mile in Dhaka.</p>
<p><b>Ethnic Composition and Distribution:</b> Bangladesh is a melting (গলন, মিশ্রণ) pot of races (জাতি). The proto-Australoids, sometimes called Veddas, were one of the earliest groups to enter the area. According to some ethnologists (জাতিতত্ত্ববিদ), they were followed by Mediterranean Caucasoids (whites), also known as Aryans. Armenoids (of Indo-European stock) are believed to have entered as well. With the coming of the Muslims in the 8th century AD, new elements were introduced; persons of Arab, Persian, and Turkish origin moved in large numbers to the subcontinent (উপমহাদেশ). By the beginning of the 13th century, they had entered what is now Bangladesh.</p>
<p><b>Religions:</b> More than 85 percent of the population follows the religion of Islam, which was made the state religion by a 1988 <b>constitutional</b> (সাংবিধানিক) amendment (পরিবর্তন, সংশোধন). The rest of the people are mainly <p><ol><li>Hindus</li></p> <p><li>Buddhists</li></p><p><li>Christians</li></p></p></ol>
<p><b>Festivals:</b> The main festivals in Bangladesh are religious. The two most important are <b>Eid Ul Fitr,</b> which comes at the end of <b>Ramadan,</b> the Muslim month of fasting (রোজা, উপবাস), and <b>Eid UI Azha,</b> or <b>the festival of sacrifice</b> (ত্যাগ, উৎসর্গ), which follows two and a half months later. On both occasions families and friends exchange (বিনিময় করে) happiness to each other. The Hindus observe different pujas such as <b>Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Janmastami</b> etc. The Buddhists observe <b>Buddha Purnima</b>. The Christian communities also observe their religious festivals like <b>Christmas day</b> and other festivals.</p>
<p><b>Rivers:</b> The main rivers of the country include the <ul><li>Padma</li></ul>
    <ul><li>the Meghna</li></ul>
    <ul><li>the Jamuna</li></ul>
